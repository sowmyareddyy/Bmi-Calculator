**BMI Calculator**

**Overview**  
The BMI Calculator is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) and determine their weight category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese). The application also saves the BMI calculation history to a text file for future reference.

**Motivation**  
Monitoring BMI is a simple yet effective way to assess overall health and identify potential risks related to weight. This project aims to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for calculating BMI, helping them stay informed about their health status without relying on external resources.

**Objectives**  
- Allow users to input their weight in kilograms and height in either centimeters or meters.
- Calculate the BMI based on the provided inputs.
- Display the BMI result along with the corresponding weight category.
- Save the BMI history, including weight, height, BMI, and category, to a text file.
- Implement error handling for invalid or missing inputs.

**Features**  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean Tkinter-based GUI with intuitive input fields and buttons.
- **Height Flexibility**: Accepts height in both centimeters and meters, automatically converting as needed.
- **Result Display**: Shows the BMI result and weight category clearly on the interface.
- **History Tracking**: Automatically saves each calculation to a text file for future reference.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for invalid or non-numeric inputs.

**Usage**  
1. Open the application.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms.
3. Enter your height in centimeters or meters.
4. Click the **Calculate BMI** button.
5. View your BMI result and weight category displayed on the screen.
6. The calculation will be saved to a file named `bmi_history.txt`.

**Conclusion**  
The BMI Calculator offers a convenient and reliable way for users to monitor their BMI and maintain awareness of their health status. With features like automatic history saving and comprehensive error handling, the application ensures both ease of use and accuracy in results.
